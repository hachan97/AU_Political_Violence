**Project Summary**

This repository contains the code and data for a research project investigating the relationship between Secret Police Organizations, institutional fragmentation, and state repression in authoritarian regimes. The project employs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression with country-fixed effects to address confounding factors.

The preliminary Top-half of this descriptive plot shows us that provides an initial bivariate comparison of the different repression events between countries with and without a secret police, highlighting a more pronounced level of Selective repression events in nations where a secret police is operational, but a somewhat insignificant difference of Indiscriminate repression in nations where a secret police is operational. While the bottom-half of the provides an initial comparison of the number of Selective and Indiscriminate repression events in varying numbers of Counterbalances, but indicates no obvious distinction in higher levels of Counterbalances.

The results consistently support the hypothesis that the presence of Secret Police is associated with an escalation in selectively targeted repression events within authoritarian regimes. However, the evidence falls short of providing substantial support for the expectation that the presence of Secret Police leads to a decrease in indiscriminate repression events. Additionally, the nuanced hypothesis suggesting that an increase in selective repression would concurrently result in a reduction in indiscriminate repression is not substantiated by the findings.
